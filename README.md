# Tutorials 

**1. Generate Markdown Table**: 

Certainly! Here's a code snippet that defines a function `generate_markdown_table` which takes a dictionary as input and outputs a formatted markdown table:

```python
def generate_markdown_table(data):
    # Get the keys from the dictionary for table headers
    headers = list(data.keys())

    # Generate the table header row
    header_row = "| " + " | ".join(headers) + " |"

    # Generate the table header separator row
    separator_row = "| " + " | ".join(["---"] * len(headers)) + " |"

    # Generate the table rows
    rows = []
    for values in zip(*data.values()):
        row = "| " + " | ".join(str(value) for value in values) + " |"
        rows.append(row)

    # Combine all the rows into a markdown table
    markdown_table = "\n".join([header_row, separator_row] + rows)

    return markdown_table
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary of data to it. For example:

```python
data = {
    "Name": ["John", "Alice", "Bob"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35],
    "City": ["New York", "London", "Paris"]
}

table = generate_markdown_table(data)
print(table)
```

This will output the following formatted markdown table:

```
| Name | Age | City     |
| ---  | --- | ---      |
| John | 25  | New York |
| Alice| 30  | London   |
| Bob  | 35  | Paris    |
```

You can modify the `data` dictionary to include your own data and the function will generate the corresponding markdown table. 

**2. Generate Bullet List**: 

```python
def generate_bullet_list(data):
    markdown = ""
    for item in data:
        markdown += f"- {item}\n"
    return markdown
```

Example usage:
```python
data = ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]
markdown = generate_bullet_list(data)
print(markdown)
```

Output:
```
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3
```

**3. Generate Markdown Heading**: 

```python
def generate_markdown_heading(level, content):
    if level < 1 or level > 6:
        raise ValueError("Heading level must be between 1 and 6")
    
    heading_symbol = '#' * level
    return f"{heading_symbol} {content}"

# Example usage
heading = generate_markdown_heading(1, "Main Heading")
print(heading)
```

Output:
```
# Main Heading
```

**4. Calculate Average**: 

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average
```

Example usage:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(average)  # Output: 3.0
```

**5. Sort Strings**: 

```python
def sort_strings(strings):
    """
    Sorts a list of strings in alphabetical order.

    Args:
        strings (list): A list of strings to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of strings.
    """
    sorted_strings = sorted(strings)
    return sorted_strings
```

Example usage:

```python
strings = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"]
sorted_strings = sort_strings(strings)
print(sorted_strings)
```

Output:
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```

**6. Is Palindrome**: 

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.

    Args:
        string (str): The string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase
    string = string.replace(" ", "").lower()

    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    if string == string[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Example usage:

```python
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # False
print(is_palindrome("A man a plan a canal Panama"))  # True
```

Note: The function removes spaces and converts the string to lowercase before checking if it is a palindrome.

**7. Convert To Lowercase ( String )**: 

```python
def convert_to_lowercase(string):
    """
    Converts a given string to lowercase.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The converted lowercase string.
    """
    return string.lower()
```

Example usage:
```python
input_string = "Hello World!"
lowercase_string = convert_to_lowercase(input_string)
print(lowercase_string)  # Output: hello world!
```

Note: This function utilizes the built-in `lower()` method of the string class in Python to convert the string to lowercase.

**8. Count Occurrences**: 

```python
def count_occurrences(lst, element):
    count = 0
    for item in lst:
        if item == element:
            count += 1
    return count
```

You can use the `count_occurrences` function to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list. Simply pass the list and the element as arguments to the function. It will iterate over the list and increment the count each time it encounters the specified element. Finally, it will return the total count.

**9. Factorial**: 

To calculate the factorial of a given number, you can use the following code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

This code defines a recursive function called `factorial` that takes in a number `n` as input. It checks if `n` is equal to 0, and if so, returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 is defined as 1). Otherwise, it recursively calls the `factorial` function with `n-1` as the argument and multiplies the result with `n`. The recursion continues until `n` reaches 0.

You can use this function to calculate the factorial of a given number by calling it with the desired number as an argument. For example:

```python
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

Output:
```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```

Note: The factorial function is only defined for non-negative integers.

**10. Is Prime**: 

To create a function that checks if a given number is prime, you can use the following code:

```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function takes a number as an input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. It uses a basic primality test by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if any of the numbers divide the given number evenly. If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.

You can use the function like this:

```python
number = 17
if is_prime(number):
    print(f"{number} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a prime number.")
```

This will output: `17 is a prime number.` 

**11. Find Maximum**: 

```python
def find_maximum(numbers):
    """
    Finds the maximum element in a list of numbers.

    Args:
    - numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    - The maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return None

    maximum = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > maximum:
            maximum = num

    return maximum
```

This function `find_maximum` takes in a list of numbers and returns the maximum element in the list. It iterates through the list and keeps track of the maximum value found so far. Finally, it returns the maximum value. If the input list is empty, the function returns `None`.

**12. Calculate Sum ( Numbers )**: 

Here is a code snippet that implements a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the sum of a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
        
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers)
```

You can use this function by passing a list of numbers as an argument, and it will return the sum of those numbers. For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements.

**13. Remove Duplicates**: 

```python
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    """
    Removes duplicates from a list and returns a new list without duplicates.
    
    Args:
    lst (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new list without duplicates.
    """
    return list(set(lst))
```

Example usage:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1]
unique_numbers = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**14. Reverse String ( Input String )**: 

```python
def reverse_string(input_string):
    """
    Reverses the given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The string to be reversed.

    Returns:
        str: The reversed string.
    """
    return input_string[::-1]
```

Example usage:
```python
input_string = "Hello, World!"
reversed_string = reverse_string(input_string)
print(reversed_string)  # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
```
