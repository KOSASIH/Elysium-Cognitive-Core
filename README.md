# Tutorials 

Certainly! Here's a code snippet that defines a function `generate_markdown_table` which takes a dictionary as input and outputs a formatted markdown table:

```python
def generate_markdown_table(data):
    # Get the keys from the dictionary for table headers
    headers = list(data.keys())

    # Generate the table header row
    header_row = "| " + " | ".join(headers) + " |"

    # Generate the table header separator row
    separator_row = "| " + " | ".join(["---"] * len(headers)) + " |"

    # Generate the table rows
    rows = []
    for values in zip(*data.values()):
        row = "| " + " | ".join(str(value) for value in values) + " |"
        rows.append(row)

    # Combine all the rows into a markdown table
    markdown_table = "\n".join([header_row, separator_row] + rows)

    return markdown_table
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary of data to it. For example:

```python
data = {
    "Name": ["John", "Alice", "Bob"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35],
    "City": ["New York", "London", "Paris"]
}

table = generate_markdown_table(data)
print(table)
```

This will output the following formatted markdown table:

```
| Name | Age | City     |
| ---  | --- | ---      |
| John | 25  | New York |
| Alice| 30  | London   |
| Bob  | 35  | Paris    |
```

You can modify the `data` dictionary to include your own data and the function will generate the corresponding markdown table.
